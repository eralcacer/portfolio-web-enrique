# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my portfolio's source code. It is a single-page website with multiple sections:
	-Welcome/Introduction section
	-Experience/Education section
	-Portfolio's section

All the content is in a folder called content with a file that contains all the information for the website, allowing others to clone the project to be used with their own information.

If you plan to use this portfolio, please give credit.
