# Portfolio Template Website with TypeScript and React

This is my portfolio's source code. It is a single-page website with multiple sections:
	-Welcome/Introduction section
	-Experience/Education section
	-Portfolio's section

All the content is in a folder called "content" with a file that contains all the information for the website, allowing others to clone the project to be used with their information.

If you plan to use this portfolio, please give credit.
